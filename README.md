# Expedition 33 Clair Obscur XeSS 2.0.1.41
XeSS 2.0.1.41 Installer batch script for Expedition 33 Clair Obscur

Usage:

Download the batch file from latest release [here](https://github.com/morpheasgr/Expedition33CO_XeSS_2.0.1/releases/latest/download/xess_upd.bat) or via cloning/zipping the repo.

1. Place xess_upd.bat into the following game subdirectory:

Expedition 33\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace\XeSS\Binaries\ThirdParty\Win64

2. Run xess_upd.bat


Notes:

To unpack the downloaded files this script initially fetches
and uses 7zip's 7zr to extract 7za,
both files are downloaded from the official GitHub repo.
Then it fetches XeSS 2.0.1 from Intel's GitHub.
